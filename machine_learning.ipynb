If one has a dataset with social media posts already categorized into themes, then supervised learning is appropriate. One can train a model to learn from these labeled examples and then categorize new posts based on what it has learned. However, if one does not have labeled data, unsupervised learning techniques can be used to discover themes or topics in the posts without needing predefined categories."
